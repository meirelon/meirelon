### Hi ðŸ‘‹


### About Me
I'm passionate and results-driven with a knack for transforming data into actionable insights. My formal mathematics & statistics studies paired with modern data and developer practices continue to provide me with ample opportunities to solve complex problems and making data work for businesses at scale.

My journey in the data world has led me to diverse roles, from Director of Data Science for a [Private Equity firm](https://www.musicapital.net) specializing in music content rights to leading data science teams at global companies like [Spotify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify). I've helped companies leverage their data to secure investor funding, optimize business strategies, and create innovative solutions.

Whether it's developing predictive models, conducting ab tests, designing ETL pipelines, or building dashboards, I'm dedicated to turning data into a strategic asset.
